    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am seeking work in the field of programming with the aim of establishing myself in the sector. Although I do not yet have professional experience, I have worked with various programming languages at an amateur level to solve specific, real-world problems, approaching each challenge with rigor and persistence.</p>
    <p>What I bring to any role, above all else, is my problem-solving ability, my uncompromising work ethic, and my clear, effective communication. These qualities define how I approach every task, and I consider them my greatest strenghts. Over the years, I have also developed strong teamwork, adaptability, and organisational skills, due to my extensive work experience. While I continue to refine my time management and focus more on generating original ideas from scratch, I do demonstrate creativity when it comes to improving and enriching existing concepts. I am eager to contribute, learn, and prove the value I can bring to a professional programming team.</p>
